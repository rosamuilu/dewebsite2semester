A brief paragraph describing the purpose of the website 
including the message/information to be conveyed:

This website is meant to draw attention to and make the user question the widespread surveillance in the society.
The dataset from the Atlas of Surveillance is quite large, but on the website it is formatted into bitesized chunks.
After viewing the data of a specific city, the user is invited to look into S.T.O.P., an organisation taking action against mass surveillance.
